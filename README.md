# Abstract: 
Background: We continue to struggle with the prevention and treatment of the influenza 
virus. The 2009 swine flu pandemic, caused by the H1N1 strain of influenza A, resulted in numer
ous fatalities. The threat of influenza remains a significant concern for global health, and the devel
opment of novel drugs targeting these viruses is highly desirable. 

Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the inhibitory potential of terpenoid compounds 
against the Nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus, which is a highly effective drug target due to 
its ability to facilitate the transcription and replication of viral RNA.

Method: In silico research was performed to identify potential inhibitors of NP. Molecular docking 
studies were conducted to assess the binding of terpenoid compounds to the active site residues of 
the target protein. The most promising hits were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations 
to examine the stability of the protein-ligand complexes. Additionally, ADMET (Absorption, Dis
tribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) studies and Lipinski's rule of five were employed to 
evaluate the drug safety and druglikeness of the compounds. 

Result: Docking studies revealed that the terpenoid compounds bind strongly to the active site resi
dues of the NP protein. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of the protein
ligand complexes for the best-hit compounds. ADMET studies and Lipinski's filter indicated that 
the compounds exhibit desirable drug safety and drug-likeness profiles. 

Conclusion: This work may contribute significantly to drug discovery and the development of 
therapeutic agents against the influenza A virus. The identification of terpenoid compounds that 
bind strongly to the NP protein and exhibit favorable drug-like properties through in silico studies 
provides a promising foundation for further research and the development of potential inhibitors 
targeting this critical viral protein.
